*** INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS ***
1. Create an ArmSwinger folder in your project's Assets directory
2. Download or clone the entire repository into the ArmSwinger folder
3. Ensure that SteamVR Unity Plugin has been imported into your project
4. If you haven't already, create a CameraRig prefab instance from the SteamVR Unity Plugin
5. Drag and drop the "Assets/ArmSwinger/scripts/ArmSwinger" script onto your CameraRig game object

All settings are set to sane defaults, and the script should work fine out-of-the-box.

You should seriously consider changing the following settings according to your needs:

• Raycast - Ground Layer Mask
• Prevent Wall Clip - Layer Mask
