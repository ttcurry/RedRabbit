ArmSwinger version: v1.3.2

*** ChangeLog ***
* v1.3.2 (11/03/2016)
- Fix bug where rewinds and push backs moved the player incorrectly if the CameraRig was rotated

* v1.3.1 (11/03/2016)
- Merge in the custom button changes (GitHub version)
- Fix a few instances that induce infinite rewinds, especially when the headset is active but not tracking.

* v1.3 (09/24/2016)
- Add support for setting a custom ArmSwing activator button (Menu, Grips, Touchpad Click, or Trigger)

* v1.2 (08/23/2016)
- Inspector now includes headers for each section of settings
- playAreaHeightAdjustmentPaused now applies when arm swinging
- all pause variables tested and handle unpausing better

* v1.1 (08/2016)
- Players no longer get stuck in walls or behind geometry if traveling at sufficient speed
- Removed Wall Clip Speed Penalty
- More reliably return to the Wall O' Settings in the test scene
- ArmSwinger will now adjust the Fixed Timestep to 0.0111 (90 ticks per second) if it is set to a higher value.  Disable this behavior by disabling the "General - Auto Adjust Fixed Timestep" setting.  Higher values will cause jerky arm swing movement.

* v1.0.2 (08/2016)
- Push Back for instant climbing/falling should now work again

* v1.0.1 (08/2016)
- Fixed infinite rewind bug when a rewind moves the player up more than maxInstantHeightChange (https://github.com/ElectricNightOwl/ArmSwinger/issues/20)
- Combined checksMinDistanceChangeToCheckAngles and rewindMinDistanceChangeToSavePosition to ensure unsafe positions aren't saved (https://github.com/ElectricNightOwl/ArmSwinger/issues/21)
- Updated defaults in test scene and ArmSwinger.cs to account for these changes

* v1.0 (08/2016)
- Initial Release
